# FishFeeder
Bill of materials:
  - Tower Pro SG92R Micro Servo
  - Raspberry Pi Pico (Or other similarly sized Microcontroller)
  - 3D Printed Parts

Upload the micropython code to the raspberry pi. It is currently set to feed twice every 24 hours by shifting the microservo left and right to move the feeding arm. Assemble by stacking the parts in the order of the image, and hold together with two rods plus super glue. 

This is a remix of a model by a user named Jo_5 on thingiverse, modified to function with the smaller Micro Servo and a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino. I have since been unable to find the original creator.

Wiring Diagram (Very simple thanks to the micro servo working with the pico's 3v supply):
