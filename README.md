Bill of materials:
  - Tower Pro SG92R Micro Servo
  - Raspberry Pi Pico (Or other similarly sized Microcontroller)
  - 3D Printed Parts

Upload the micropython code to the raspberry pi. It is currently set to feed twicee every 24 hours by shifting the microservo left and right to move the feeding arm. 
This is a remix of a model by a user named Jo_5 on thingiverse, modified to function with the smaller Micro Servo and a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino. I have since been unable to find the original creator.
